## ASP .NET CRUD Validator

# Overview
This is a web application built using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework, focused on managing client information. It supports the basic operations of creating, reading, updating, and deleting client records. The application includes a simple interface for these actions. To ensure everything works as expected, we've added automated tests using Selenium.

# Features
CRUD Operations: Allows for managing client records through a web interface.
Automated Testing: Includes Selenium tests for verifying the application's functionality.

# Project Components
ASP.NET MVC Framework: For building the application's web interface.
Entity Framework: Used for database operations.
Selenium: For automating browser actions to test the web application.

# Testing
The project contains automated tests to check:

Adding a new client and seeing it appear in the list.
Updating a client's details and ensuring the changes are reflected.
Removing a client and confirming it's no longer listed.
These tests help maintain the reliability of the application by automatically checking for errors in the CRUD operations.
